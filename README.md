This challenge is about building a functional code quiz that has a timer and gives the user an option to submit their highscores. There isnt much HTML or CSS, therefore its mostly javascript. This assigment was challenging and its a good way to practice javascript.

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


#Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
